**Quantifying the global film festival circuit: Networks, diversity, and public value creation**
<br> by Vejune Zemaityte, Andres Karjus, Ulrike Rohn, Maximilian Schich, Indrek Ibrus

To replicate the analyses and recreate the graphs, follow these steps:
- install R (4.2.1 or higher; we recommend using RStudio as the IDE)
- unpack the data and place it in a folder of choice along with the script files (or the folder reported by `getwd()` in R)
- open the quantifying_festivalcircuit.R file in R/RStudio
- follow the steps in quantifying_festivalcircuit.R: source the functions R script file (this also installs packages if missing), and run all lines in the file to recreate the analyses and graphs; the graphs will be exported into the working directory.

A dashboard with interactive versions of the graphs of the paper is available here: https://andreskarjus.github.io/cinandofestivals
